<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  Hello, my name is Baudunova Shakhida! I’m a senior student in the Software
  Engineering department. Lately, I’ve been especially interested in web
  development, frontend in particular, because I enjoy working on the part of a
  product that people actually see and interact with. I’d like to strengthen my
  frontend skills, learn more about modern tools and best practices, and build
  web pages that look clean, responsive, and well structured.
