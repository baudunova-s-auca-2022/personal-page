        Hello, my name is Baudunova Shakhida! I’m a senior Software Engineering
        student and a professional taekwondo athlete. I like reading books,
        especially fantasy, detective and novels. I also like playing board
        games. My favourite one is the Kyrgyz board game Toguz Korgool. I’m
        interested in frontend development and want to improve my skills with
        modern tools.

        My dream is to continue my sports career after graduating from
        university. I also want to apply for a master’s degree in the United
        States or somewhere in Europe. I want to travel a lot and discover new
        places and cultures.
